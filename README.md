## About
* Think Metasploit, but for external enumeration...
*	TireFire is a scalable and straightforward platform to place your operational workflow. 
*	Based on the terminal emulator Tilix to give a GUI feel with the convenience of CLI.
*	The database for TireFire (Main.csv) is easily altered to support your methodologies as they are substituted and appended.
*	Great for HTB and OSCP like machines.
*	TireFire is a product of 19% security solutions. 
## Demo
![Tire Fire](https://github.com/CoolHandSquid/TireFire/blob/TireFire_V3/Images/TireFireFinal1.gif)
## Kickoff
```
sudo TireFire 10.10.10.5
```
<!--
## HowTo
*	TireFire will not function well if not run as root.
*	Once Build.sh has been run, TireFire will have been added to your path.
*	From the "Main Table," type the corresponding number of a protocol for which you would like to run a scan.
*	From the "Protocol Table," click the corresponding number of a scan you would like to run. The scan will be kicked off in another tab.
*	Hit enter to return to the "Main Table."
*	You can change the variables by going to the "Variables Table."
*	If there is a scan or series of scans for a protocol, you would like to add, edit Main.csv following the guidelines in this README (it's pretty straight forward).
*	Tables and commands can be added while TireFire is running, and it will be populated once Main.csv is saved.
-->
## Methodology
1. Kickoff TireFire (TireFire 10.10.10.5).
2. When prompted, type "Y" to kickoff a Quick, Banner, All-Port, and UDP nmap scan.
3. Depending upon the ports returned, run scans for those ports. 
4. Choose lower numbered scans for the corresponding port and then higher ones as you need to get more specific.
5. Change variables as you need to suit your target (Example: HTTP running on port 8500).
## ProTips
- Run multiple commands from a table at once by splitting the command numbers with commas. EX: 0,1,2 (Spaces and periods work aswell)
![alt text](https://github.com/CoolHandSquid/TireFire/blob/TireFire_V3/Images/4_split.png)
- Ctrl+Z will bring you back to the main TireFire Page.
- Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown will allow you to peruse through open tabs.
- Ctrl+S will split the screen.
- Ctrl+T for a new tab.
- Ctrl+h for help.
## Build
```
git clone https://github.com/CoolHandSquid/TireFire.git
cd TireFire
sudo ./Build.sh
```
## Adding Modules
- Open Main.csv with your favorite csv editor (I'm partial to ModernCSV and Excel).
- When adding a command, keep in mind Name, Port, and Description are for the primary display screen; Cmd_Name, Cmd_Description, Cmd_Command, Cmd_Comment, and SubDisplayOrder are for the secondary display screen.

### Special Characters and Syntax
-	Cmd_Command has a few special characters including &&&&, #, ##, ?, and {}.
### &&&&
-	&&&& Anywhere in the command will split the line and start each command individually in separate tabs.
  -	Example: whoami &&&& id &&&& ifconfig will open three tabs and run the desired command in each. &&&& is useful if you initially run multiple separate commands every time you see a specific port open.
### \# and \#\#
-	"#" is for sending yourself notes to another tab.  
- "#" can be useful if you don't want to run a command, but you want to give yourself copy-paste notes for manual enumeration.
- Set only the first character of the line to # if you want variables to be evaluated.
- Set the first two characters of the line to ## if you do not want variables to be evaluated.
### ?
- "?" is for sending a question to the user. The responce will be set to a numbered variable.
- You can send multiple lines of questions for multiple variables.
- Example:
```
?What is the location of the wp-login.php? Example: /Yeet/cannon/wp-login.php
?What is a known password you would like to brute force?
wpscan --url {Web_Proto}://{IP}{1} --enumerate u,tt,t,vp --password {2} -e 
```
### {}
-	{} is for grabbing a variable from TireFire.
- Available variables can be viewed in the variables table.
